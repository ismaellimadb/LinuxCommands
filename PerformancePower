To view available speed governors use this command:

$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_available_governors 
performance powersave
If you do have more than one governor you can check what is currently in use with this command:

$ cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor
powersave
To change your processor to performance mode use:

$ echo performance | sudo tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor
performance


You can install a CPU frequence controller with this command:

    sudo apt-get install indicator-cpufreq
Then reboot, go to the notification area (the right side of the top panel), click on the cpu frequence indicator and then select Performance.
